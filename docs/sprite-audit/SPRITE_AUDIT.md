# Rise of Nations Sprite Audit Report

**Generated: December 2024**
**Status: COMPREHENSIVE AUDIT COMPLETE**

## Executive Summary

This audit reviewed all 5 age-specific sprite sheets and IsoCity sprite sheets to find the optimal sprite mapping for each RoN building type across all ages.

### Key Improvements Made:
1. **Age-specific sprite mappings** - Each age now uses the most appropriate sprite for each building
2. **Farm sprites** - Now use IsoCity farm sheet with era-appropriate sprites (windmill for medieval, greenhouse for modern, etc.)
3. **Fixed incorrect mappings** - Market, stable, library, university, and many more now use correct sprites

## Problem Sprites Identified

### Era-Inappropriate Sprites in Medieval Sheet:
- (2,1) Water tower - Should be medieval well
- (2,2) Industrial factory - Should be blacksmith
- (2,3) Modern stadium - Should be jousting grounds
- (2,4) Observatory - Should be scriptorium
- (4,4) Industrial refinery - Should be brewery

### Era-Inappropriate Sprites in Enlightenment Sheet:
- (1,2) Tennis court - Wrong era
- (2,3) Wind turbines - 21st century!
- (4,4) Modern oil refinery - Too modern
- (5,4) Carousel - 19th century

## Missing Building Types

Buildings that need special handling:
- **Airbase** - Uses IsoCity airport sprite (`/assets/buildings/airport.webp`)
- **Farms** - Uses IsoCity farm sheet with age-specific sprites
- **Dock** - Some ages lack proper waterfront buildings

---

## Scripts Created

### `scripts/extract-sprite.mjs`
Extract RoN building sprites:
```bash
node scripts/extract-sprite.mjs farm classical
node scripts/extract-sprite.mjs --all
node scripts/extract-sprite.mjs --list medieval
```

### `scripts/extract-isocity-sprite.mjs`
Extract IsoCity sprites:
```bash
node scripts/extract-isocity-sprite.mjs farm 2 4  # Windmill
node scripts/extract-isocity-sprite.mjs --list
node scripts/extract-isocity-sprite.mjs --farm-recommendations
```

---

## Implementation

The sprite mappings are implemented in:
- `src/games/ron/lib/renderConfig.ts` - `AGE_BUILDING_OVERRIDES` for age-specific mappings
- `src/games/ron/components/RoNCanvas.tsx` - Uses `getAgeSpritePosition()` for rendering

Age-specific farm sprites are hardcoded in `RoNCanvas.tsx` for each age.
