## Weather & Seasons

- Each in-game month now maps to a meteorological season (winter, spring, summer, fall) with distinct probabilities for rain, snow, lightning storms, and heat waves.
- Weather drives small economic modifiers (income, expenses, demand, happiness) and is surfaced directly in the desktop and mobile top bars via the new weather badge/pill.
- Visual cues include parallax cloud layers, animated precipitation, lightning flashes, and snow accumulation that blankets roads and rooftops. Severe precipitation also shortens daylight hours while clear or hot days extend them.
- The lighting system leverages seasonal day length so winter nights arrive early, while summer sunsets drift later. Weather badges also display current daylight duration so players can anticipate longer or shorter nights at a glance.
